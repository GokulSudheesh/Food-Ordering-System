This project is made with Java and mySQL. All the libraries that I've used are added to another repository.
The app will allow the user to make an account which would be used to take orders. The menu consists of Main Course and Desserts. There is also a registration menu for new employees. 

All the details of the user, their order etc will be saved in mySQL databse.
